	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>This site came about after trying to get access to the timetable information for a stop using the official PTV website. It takes about 20 clicks (and mis-clicks) to find the information you need, even though you know exactly what you're looking for.</p>
	<p>A nice thing about this site is that I've designed it to be super simple to use - hence the "Easy PTV" name</p>
	<p>What this site does is present the timetable for a given mode/route/stop going in a particular direction. For example, you can find what times the trains go to the city from Hampton station on the Sandringham line.</p>
	<p>The way the timetables are displayed is an exact copy of the timetables displayed on tram/bus stops</p>
	<p>Like anything, this site is nowhere near perfect. Some of the ideas in the pipeline are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An iPhone/Android app. This site provides the foundation of getting all the information I need, now the obvious move is to make it an app.</li>
		<li>Choosing a destination along the route and only displaying times to that destination</li>
		<li>If you have chosen a destination on the route (or you main destination for that matter), provide the arrival time as a mouse over</li>
		<li>Save the timetables you have searched for. To do this, I may have to introduce a user registration system, but if I can avoid it I will - nobody wants yet another username/password.</li>
		<li>A map of the route would be really nice. I may be able to get them from PTV, but it will be a bit of work.</li>
		<li>Something that would be nice would be to see the times for all the different routes going through a particular stop. For example, the Frankston and Dandenong / Cranbourne lines both go through Caulfield station. It would be nice to see the time/platform of the trains going to the city.</li>
		<li>Expresses. I haven't figured out a nice way to get this information from the API yet. I'm sure I'll work it out if there is enough interest.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Feedback is more than welcome! I'd love to know what you think and what you need or like to see improved. Given the site name of "Easy PTV" - the end goal is to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
