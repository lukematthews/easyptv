This site came about after trying to get access to the timetable information for a stop using the official PTV website. It takes about 20 clicks (and mis-clicks) to find the information you need, even though you know exactly what you're looking for.

A nice thing about this site is that I've designed it to be super simple to use - hence the "Easy PTV" name

What this site does is present the timetable for a given mode/route/stop going in a particular direction. For example, you can find what times the trains go to the city from Hampton station on the Sandringham line.

The way the timetables are displayed is an exact copy of the timetables displayed on tram/bus stops

Like anything, this site is nowhere near perfect. Some of the ideas in the pipeline are:

An iPhone/Android app. This site provides the foundation of getting all the information I need, now the obvious move is to make it an app.
Choosing a destination along the route and only displaying times to that destination
If you have chosen a destination on the route (or you main destination for that matter), provide the arrival time as a mouse over
Save the timetables you have searched for. To do this, I may have to introduce a user registration system, but if I can avoid it I will - nobody wants yet another username/password.
A map of the route would be really nice. I may be able to get them from PTV, but it will be a bit of work.
Something that would be nice would be to see the times for all the different routes going through a particular stop. For example, the Frankston and Dandenong / Cranbourne lines both go through Caulfield station. It would be nice to see the time/platform of the trains going to the city.
Expresses. I haven't figured out a nice way to get this information from the API yet. I'm sure I'll work it out if there is enough interest.
Feedback is more than welcome! I'd love to know what you think and what you need or like to see improved. Given the site name of "Easy PTV" - the end goal is to keep things as simple as possible.
